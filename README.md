# Responsive-AI
This is project for PwC 

Task 2:

Responsible AI is top of mind for business leaders, along with an urgent need to understand the decision process behind these algorithms. With great potential comes great risk. Not being able to understand an AI system can lead to a “black box” effect, which limits an organisation’s ability to explain and defend business-critical decisions. 

PwC’s Responsible AI approach can help. We provide services to help explain both overall decision-making and also individual choices and predictions, tailored to the perspectives of different stakeholders.

Jakob, your team manager, is keen to meet you. Ready to hit the road? Our first stop is Geneva. Here’s an overview of the project and what I need you to do.

A large bank has asked us to evaluate the marketing algorithms they use for retail banking. Their sophisticated phone marketing algorithm predicts whether a certain person will subscribe to a term deposit or not. Based on that assessment, the bank then optimises its phone calling strategy. With this algorithm, the bank has been successful in predicting which clients are more likely to subscribe to their term deposits. 

Management is now interested in finding out how a classification model can lead to certain decision-making processes. 


Create a classification model in Python. Feel free to use libraries such as SkLearn, Keras/Tensorflow or Pytorch. 
Analyse the model and provide insight into which features/variables influence the outcome of the classification the most: on a global level, and specifically for observation #4 and #20.
Develop some form of plot or graph with brief comments on your observations.
